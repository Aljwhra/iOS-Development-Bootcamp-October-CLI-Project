# Quiz CLI App

## Description
The Swift Fundamentals Quiz App is a console-based project designed to help learners grasp the core concepts of the Swift programming language. This project involves creating a simple quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions about Swift programming. The project will cover essential Swift topics, such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more.

## Key Features

- Quiz Questions:
Prepare a set of multiple-choice questions related to Swift programming. These questions should cover various topics within Swift.
- Quiz Logic:
Implement the logic to present questions to the user, collect their answers, and provide feedback on correctness.
- Scoring System:
Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.
- Randomization:
Randomly shuffle the order of questions for each quiz session.
- Timer (Optional):
Add an optional timer to create a sense of urgency for answering questions.

## Learning Objectives

- Variables and Data Types:
Practice using variables and understanding Swift's data types.
- Control Structures:
Implement control structures like if statements and loops to control the flow of the quiz.
- Functions:
Create functions to organize code and perform specific tasks, such as checking answers and calculating scores.
- Arrays and Dictionaries:
Utilize data structures like arrays and dictionaries to manage quiz questions and answers.
- Swift Syntax:
Get hands-on experience with Swift's syntax and language conventions.
- User Input and Output:
Learn how to interact with the user through the console, taking input and providing feedback.

## Minimum Requirements
 
- Control Flow Example:
Include an example that demonstrates Swift's control flow mechanisms, such as an if statement or a switch statement. Show how these statements control the program's flow.
- Arrays or Dictionaries:
Feature code samples that involve the use of either arrays or dictionaries (or both) to illustrate Swift's data structure capabilities.
- Error Handling Example:
Create an example that illustrates Swift's error handling with a do-try-catch block or a throwing function.
- Object-Oriented Programming (Optional):
If desired, include a code sample involving an object-oriented concept, such as a class, inheritance, or protocol implementation.
